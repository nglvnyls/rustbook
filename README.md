## Method Syntax

Methods are similar to functions.

Are like functions in:

- declared with the fn keyword and their name 
- can have parameters 
- can return values
- contain some code that is run when theyâ€™re called from somewhere else

Are different for functions in:

- are defined within the context of a struct, enum or trait Object
- first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
