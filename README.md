Rustbool is a collection of exercices provided by the book ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.

## common_collections

They are **a number of very useful data structures.**

They can contain multiple values

**the data** these collections point to is **stored on the heap**, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.

Collections that are used very often in Rust programs:

- A vector
- A string
- A hash map
