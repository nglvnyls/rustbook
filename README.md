## 100 - Generic_types_traits_lifetimes

Tools for effectively handling the duplication of concepts.

**Generics** are abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties

Similar to the way a function takes parameters with unknown values to run the same code on multiple concrete values, functions can take parameters of some generic type instead of a concrete type, like i32 or String.

### Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function

In the same way that you recognize duplicated code to extract into a function, youâ€™ll start to recognize duplicated code that can use generics.
