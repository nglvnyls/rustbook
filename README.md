##### How to install

Cargo comes installed with Rust if you used the official installers discussed in the “Installation” section. If you installed Rust through some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by entering the following into your terminal:

```
$ cargo --version

```
If you see a version number, you have it!
If you see an error, such as command not found, look at the [documentation for your method of installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to determine how to install Cargo separately.
