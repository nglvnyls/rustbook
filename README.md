# rustbook
Rustbool is a collection of exercices provided by the book ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.
The exercices are made using Rust 1.42.0 or later with edition="2018" in Cargo.toml of all projects to use Rust 2018 Edition idioms.

## 111 - How to Write Tests

Tests **are Rust functions**.

The bodies of test functions **typically perform these** actions:
  - Set up any needed data or state.
  - Run the code you want to test.
  - Assert the results are what you expect.

### The Anatomy of a Test Function

#### Simplest function

A function thatâ€™s annotated with the test attribute
To change a function into a test function, **add #[test] on the line before fn**

```rust
#[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(...
    }
```
##### Checking Results with the assert! Macro

The assert! macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want **to ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to true**.

assert! macro needs an **argument that evaluates to a Boolean**. 

If the value is:
 - TRUE:   does nothing and the test passes.
 - FALSE: calls the panic! macro, which causes the test to fail
