# rustbook
Rustbool is a collection of exercices provided by the book ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols.
The exercices are made using Rust 1.42.0 or later with edition="2018" in Cargo.toml of all projects to use Rust 2018 Edition idioms.

## collection_hash (objects in javascript)

The type HashMap<K, V> stores a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V.

Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data using vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type.

### Creating a New Hash Map

It cans create an empty hash map with **new**.

Of our three common collections, this one is the least often used, so itâ€™s not included in the features brought into scope automatically in the prelude. 

Hash maps also have less support from the standard library.

Data is **stored on the heap**. 

Hash maps are homogeneous: 
 - **all of the keys** must have the same type
 - **all of the values** must have the same type.

Another way of constructing a hash map is by **using the collect method** on a vector of tuples, where each tuple consists of a key and its value.

### Hash Maps and Ownership

For types that implement the Copy trait, like i32, the values are copied into the hash map.

For owned values like String, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values
